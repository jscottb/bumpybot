# bumpybot

Lil-b is a small 100mm x 100mm servo driven robot made for beginners. The bot is easy to print as assemble, having just a few parts.

It is made from 2 platforms (one top and one base), 2 wheels, 4 servo motor mounts, 4 standoffs and two Caster-slides.

Hardware and materials you will need to assemble:

10x M3 screws
Super glue (for the motor mounts)
2x 40mm x 4mm o-ring for the wheels
2x Feetech FS90R or Adafruit 9g continuous rotation servos.
2x servo horns (should be included in the servos)
Arduino with sensor shied or the like
1x 7.4v lipo or other 5v or greater battery (a 9v battery will be ok)
1x hc-sr04
Jumper wires (Dupont)
Directions:
Print all of the parts - 1 base, 1 top, 2 wheels, 4 standoffs, 2 slide-casters, 1 face and the four motor mounts.

Take the motor mounts and glue them as picture five and six (5,6) shows.
Glue the servo horns inside the hub of the wheels.
Glue the Faceplate in the slot of the top platform (note: you may have to file or sand the edges of the insert a bit to get it in) See picture seven (7)
Screw or glue the slide casters to the bottom of the base platform (the opposite side from the motor mounts). See picture eight (8)
Let all glue dry.
Mount the servos to the base platform onto the mounting posts using the mounting screws that came with the servo. The servo shafts will be closest to the rear of the bot.
Mount the standoffs to the base platform, using 4 of the M3 screws.
Mount the top platform to the base on the standoffs using 4 M3 screws.
Place the o-rings onto the wheels inside the groove.
Mount the wheels onto the servos, and use the little screw that came with the servo to secure the wheel on.
Add the Arduino and hc-sr04 to the faceplate.
Connect the servos and hc-sr04 to the Arduino.
Program and enjoy!
The base platform has mounting holes for up to three IR sensors for line following. If you use the bot for that, then forgo adding the front slide-caster.

Update: Added taller standoffs that will allow for a 2x4 aa holder.
